LinkedIn (/ˌliŋkt.ˈɪn/) is a business- and employment-oriented social networking service that operates via websites and mobile apps. Founded on December 28, 2002,[6] and launched on May 5, 2003,[7] it is mainly used for professional networking, including employers posting jobs and job seekers posting their CVs. As of 2015, most of the company's revenue came from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales professionals.[8] As of April 2017, LinkedIn had 500 million members in 200 countries, out of which more than 106 million members are active.[5] LinkedIn allows members (both workers and employers) to create profiles and "connections" to each other in an online social network which may represent real-world professional relationships. Members can invite anyone (whether an existing member or not) to become a connection.[9] The "gated-access approach" (where contact with any professional requires either an existing relationship or an introduction through a contact of theirs) is intended to build trust among the service's members. LinkedIn participated in the EU's International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.[citation needed]

The site has an Alexa Internet ranking as the 20th most popular website (October 2016).[4] According to the New York Times, US high school students are now creating LinkedIn profiles to include with their college applications. [10] Based in the United States, the site is, as of 2013, available in 24 languages,[11] including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Romanian, Russian, Turkish, Japanese, Czech, Polish, Korean, Indonesian, Malay, and Tagalog.[12][13] LinkedIn filed for an initial public offering in January 2011 and traded its first shares on May 19, 2011, under the NYSE symbol "LNKD".[14]

On June 13, 2016, Microsoft announced plans to acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion.[15][16] The acquisition was completed on December 8, 2016.[17] The transaction resulted in the payment of approximately $26.4 billion in cash merger consideration.[18]
