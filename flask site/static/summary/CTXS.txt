Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. It was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000.

The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems. It licensed source code from Microsoft and has been in partnership with the company throughout its history. Citrix came to prominence in the 1990s as a leader in thin client technology, purpose built for accessing remote servers. The company had its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced large revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.

The company acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. Between 2005 and 2012, Citrix acquired more than a dozen other companies, allowing it to expand into server and desktop virtualization, as well as cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, and SaaS offerings. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a USD$1.8 billion product deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity, entitled GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products.

Citrix is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Santa Clara, California, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts, and additional development centers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. It currently services around 330,000 organizations worldwide. In 2014, the company was ranked 741 on the Fortune 1000. Citrix reported $3.28 billion in revenue and a net income of more than $300 million in 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of April 2017, Citrix had approximately 8,100 employees. David Henshall became the company's CEO in July 2017.
