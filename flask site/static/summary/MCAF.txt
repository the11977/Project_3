McAfee, Inc. (/ˈmækəfiː/; known as Intel Security Group in 2014–2017) is an American global computer security software company headquartered in Santa Clara, California and, it says, the world's largest dedicated security technology company.

The company was purchased by Intel in February 2011, and became part of the Intel Security division.

On September 7, 2016, Intel announced a strategic deal with TPG Capital to convert Intel Security into a joint venture between both companies called McAfee. That deal closed on April 3, 2017. Thoma Bravo took a minority stake in the new company, and Intel maintains a 49% stake.
